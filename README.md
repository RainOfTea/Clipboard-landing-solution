## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 & CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

- When several sections exist on a page, it's better to position them separately, without flexboxing the entire `<body>` or `<main>` element.
- Line-height starts from the bottom of the line, and adds space above the line (which is counter-intuitive), and should be considered when vertically spacing different text elements (such as a subheading and a paragraph).
- Easier to work with SVG images when they're inserted natively in HTML, even though it makes the HTML more messy.
